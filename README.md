# RobotArm_Inverse_Kinematics

Controls:

    - Arm: The arm follows the movements of a pointer (which is initally hidden within it's upmost joint). 
      Use the arrow keys to move the pointer along the x- and z- axis, and 'w' and 's' to move the pointer along the y-axis.
    - Pincer: The pincer will always stay parallel to the ground. Use 'o' to open/close it.
    - Camera: Use mousewheel to scroll in/out. With pressed middle mouse button you can pivot the camera around.
