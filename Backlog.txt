SHORT TERM BACKLOG

DONE:	SerializationContainer -> Portable 
DONE:	Engine.Common -> Portable
DONE:	Xirkit -> from Engine to ..
DONE:	Xirkit -> Portable
DONE:	KeyframeAnimation -> Portable
DONE:	Remove Scenemanagement Code
DONE:   Invent a convention for how to handle 
				namespaces / class names
				file names
				folders
				project file names
				generated dll names
				handwritten js projects in terms of script names and source directories
				additional dll versions for different platforms (like shared implementation dlls - probably RenderContextImp for OpenTK/Desktop vs OpenTK/Android)
			that makes sense and holds for eternity.
DONE:	Create "Core" or "Common" on Fusee level (not below Engine) containing common base functionality (like Diagnostic.Log...)
DONE:	Engine.Core -> Portable
DONE:	SimpleScene -> Portable
DONE:	Fix Rebuild All
DONE:	Create standard .Net and standard .js host apps (containing main, perhaps providing libraries)
DONE:	Unify keyboard/mouse and gamepad input
DONE:	Add Touch input
DONE:	Remove soundjs.min.js and opentype.js from JSIL.js; 
				Remove soundjs dependency from JSIL.Browser.Audio.js. 
				Put opentype and soundjs to Engine/Imp/Web/Graphics|Sound
DONE:	Refactor fuGen (and others) such that it contains no knowledge about the project structure 
			(e.g. does not contain any reference to xirkit, simplescene etc. in its code)
DONE:	Clean up Imp.Graphics (Desktop, Android, DesktopAndroid->Shared)
DONE:	Create self-built freetype & Sharpfont
			1. for Desktop
			2. for Android
DONE:	Implement Assets System capable of abstracting File-System access (Desktop), 
			Android-Asset-Handling and JavaScript awkward All-in-one async-only 
			asset loading approach (e.g. img.OnLoad) wrapped by JSIL.Browser asset loaders.
DONE:	Remove Font implementation from RenderContext (probably even from Imp.Graphics)

DONE:	Check if Kerning works.

DONE:	Clean-up Fusee.Engine.Simple build
DONE:	Test creating an external project (not below FUSEE)
		Create a project template for external projects
DONE:	Document first steps (creating a new project)
DONE:	Create new Develop branch and make it the main branch
DONE:	Find a solution how to include Assets in Android-builds from the application's 
			platform-agnostic Core-Project	
DONE: 	Publish self-built freetype & Sharpfont on GitHub
DONE:	Transform Examples to portable DLLs

	########### fusee binary distro ##############

DONE:	Create "dotnet new fusee" template.
			See https://github.com/dotnet/templating/wiki
			and https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/04/02/how-to-create-your-own-templates-for-dotnet-new/
		
		Create "fusee" command mimicking other package commands ("git", "dotnet", "nuget", ...)
		Main purpose is to enable a binary FUSEE distribution to be used platform independently
		and to provide tooling needed during build of such packages
			Implement these verbs:
DONE:			- publish: with options "Desktop, Web " (Desktop first: Simply pack the player, .Core DLL and assets into one directory)
					- and Android
DONE:			- server:  start a local webserver to host web builds (incorporate fuHttp)
			
		Include all other stuff below the Tools directory into fusee.exe. 
DONE:			- WARNING: Be aware of cyclic dependencies during the build of "fuseeCmdLine" (Just don't copy Player from bin. Directly reference bin instead)
DONE:			- Copy "fuConv web" functionality and replace "fuconv web" calls in Blender Export AddOn
DONE:1			- Copy "fuGen" functionality (create "generate" verb) and replace fuGen call in fuseeTargets.xml
DONE:2			- Mark "web" and "generate" verbs as deprecated
				- unify "web", "publish -p Web" and "generate" commands 
				- Replace .tt (T4) Text-Templating. Seems somehow deprecated.

3		Make root Fusee.sln build fusee.exe and Player (remove Simple and/or Viewer)
4		Make all application "Desktop" projects 64bit
5		Remove x32 Solution configuration from all Solutions (Fusee.sln (=Player), Simple.sln, Viewer.sln)
6		Fix project dependencies in all above solutions
7		Remove Viewer from sources
		
8		Make all application "Desktop" projects 64bit in FuseeTutorial (Game Engineering tuts)
9		Make all application "Desktop" projects 64bit in ComputergrafikMIB tuts 	
		
		Integrate Protobuf python code generation (yielding Scene_pb2.py) into Fusee build process
		
				
		Make fuseeCmdLine Mono Compatible [.Net Core 2.0 executable - no good idea, results in a dll rather than an .exe]
			Make it run on Mac!
		
		Evaluate possibility to make the "fusee" command line part of "dotnet fusee"
			See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/extensibility
			
		Create "Installer" for a "Fusee binary distribution"
			Evaluate different approaches including
				Unzip, set "FuseeRoot", set Path to fusee.exe, install dotnet new template, maybe install dotnet fusee command
				NuGet to do the above (Question: is the FUSEE runtime too much weight on a per-project basis (instead of a per-dev-machine basis)?)

		
				
	############ blender integration ##############	
	
		Allow new type of FUSEE .Core Dlls implementing "behavior" classes to be attached
		to individual scene graph nodes instead of one overall RenderCanvas derivative.
		
		Extend Blender AddIn 
			Allow useres to add FUSEE based extra information on blender objects e.g. Property Names, possible events, etc.
			Export .fus-file with accompanying set of partial behavior class .cs files defining the properties and enough information
			to wire scenegraph object instances to behaviour instances at startup.
		
	############ long term goals ####################	
	
		Convert Sound to Assets
		Implement Android sound handling
		
		Remove FontMap.FixKerning. Instead of fixing existing geometry provide methods to create kerned geometry in the first place.
		Document AssetStorage and under-the-hood mechanism.

		Rewrite asset system NOT using JSIL's XNA-mimicking asset system. Instead directly use XHTMLRequest (or some JSIL in-between lighter than XNA-assets)
				in conjunction with soundjs/opentype handling (NOT NECESSARY ANY MORE)
				let users decide to load assets in advance / on demand / progressively
		Restructure input (move keyboard/mouse out of Graphics)
		Clean-up gamepad input (implement new interfaces, ...)
		Clean up Imp.Graphics (Desktop/Windows...)
		Clean up GitHub projects (fuTools, external binaries, ...)
		Report JSIL issues:
			1. Eliminating XNA causes trouble with audio and image loading (see ext/JSIL/README.md)
			2. Using IEnumerable Extensions and LINQ in portable libraries causes JSIL crashes in JSIL.Internal.FunctionTransformFailureException: Function transform pipeline stage
			3. issue regarding Dead Code Removal and how to avoid self-written mscorlib, System (everything under ext/JSIL/FrameworkScripts
		Remove all warnings
		Use JSIL to translate a csproj at a time (with each .csproj triggering its own x-compilation as a post build event)
		Fix Light position when applying bone animation (without normal map).
		Fix RC Model/View/ModelView behaviour (1. View-only: awkward, 2. Model!=Id & View!=Id: Hierarchy broken.
DONE:	Jometri integration (portable)
		Try JSIL's PackedArray (= js typed array or arraybuffer) implementation on Mesh (and probably also MeshContainer/Component)
		Use arraybuffer loading on XHTMLRequests loading mesh data (if possible - problem is that only parts of .fus should be read as arraybuffers, other parts rather not)
		Minimize mscorlib with current JSIL-on-board functionality (instead of providing our own JSIL)
		Completely remove FUSEE/JSIL (or replace it by a non-altered version of standard JSIL)
		Move physics stuff out of core
		Look at http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/620154/UniversalSerializer. Can we create a precompiler?
